% This is the main file for the Data Postprocessing Project. In this
% project users will be able to analyze data collected from launches. Users
% will be expected to input one or multiple sources of data surrounding the
% launch. Users will also have the option of inputting predicted data. For
% more details, please check the README file

% Sources will be inputted using the createSourceObject method. Each source 
% will have be inputted using its path location, source type, and its title.
% Finally, the createSourceObject will include a parameter for where the 
% lists should be stored.
%
% The title string is what it will be labeled as in and legend
%
% For example 
% [~, sourceList] = createSourceObject("rawData/exampleFile", "easyMini", "EasyMini Data", sourceList);
% [~, sourceList] = createSourceObject("rawData/exampleFile2", "RASAeroII", "RAS 0AoA", sourceList);
